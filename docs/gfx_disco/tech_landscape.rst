Technology Landscape
====================

Displays
--------

CRTs ruled the day. TVs were the most common. These used (in America) 60Hz, refresh rates with 525 interlaced scan-lines. Of these about 480 was visible on the screen. On the other side of the pond, the PAL standard ran at 50Hz refresh and 625 scan-lines of which 576 was visible.

Computers at the time mostly used progressive-scan variants (that is, they simply generated the same image for both fields, many times not even bothering with the half-scan-line termination between them).

Depending on over-scan assumptions, these facts percolated into a supported vertical resolution of either 200 (NTSC) or 256 (PAL).

The corresponding horizontal resolution was often chosen as 320 pixels, which (using 8x8 pixel characters) translated into a 40-character wide display.

The horizontal sync-rate was 15.734kHz (NTSC) or 15.625kHz (PAL).

Typical of the time would have been the screen of the Commodore 64, which `used <https://codebase64.org/doku.php?id=base:pixel_aspect_ratio>`_ 6.13636MHz and 7.375MHz pixel clock rates on NTSC and PAL systems respectively.

When proper monitors were used, the same timing was preserved, but the horizontal resolution could be doubled due to the increase in available analog video bandwidth. Typically the vertical resolution was kept the same and interlace was almost never used due to flickering artifacts.

Sound
-----

Most contemporaries had either single-bit beepers or very simple sound generators. The Commodore 64 stands out with it's SID chip: three voices, each with it's own tone and envelope generators.

On the more professional end of the spectrum, FM synthesis was coming of age within Yamaha. MIDI was introduced in 1981 and 1982 saw the first CD player on the market. High quality audio DACs were still a rarity and expensive. ADCs even more so. Delta-sigma modulation was known for a long time, but it was not widely used for audio to my knowledge. Even the `Amiga 1000 <https://erikarn.github.io/amiga/1000/Amiga_A1000_Schematics_2.pdf>`_ introduced years later used complex analog anti-aliasing filters, indicating that their DACs were rather simple.
