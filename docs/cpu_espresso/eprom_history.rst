Timing
~~~~~~

According to a typical `datasheet <https://datasheet.octopart.com/D27256-2-Intel-datasheet-17852618.pdf>`__ access times are 250ns, though there are several speed-grades available. By '91, CMOS EPROMs were available with access times roughly half of that: 120ns was available.

At that time same-capacity (and speed) FLASH parts started to appear too - not 5V programmable parts though. They required ~10ns hold-times on data (relative to the rising edge of nWE), which is something that DRAMs didn't have.
