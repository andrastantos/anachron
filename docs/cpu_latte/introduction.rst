Latte in a nutshell
===================

Latte is a second generation processor based on the BREW ISA. It is targeting 1u process, roughly in line in terms of timeline with the i386 processor. Target clock speed of 20MHz, with support for FPM memories.

Latte is intended to be pin-compatible with Espresso, which means, still only an 8-bit external bus, albeit at ~twice the speed. This is enabled by FPM memories.
